# murphy_bed
Solidworks design of a welded steel murphy bed.  
See https://youtu.be/TQrmLlXUtIQ

This is being constructed to solve some problems of light sleepers in a crowded city: 
- Not enough space.
- I prefer hard surfaces (e.g. a camping mat), my partner soft (memory foam).
- If we're on the same mattress, we wake each other as we toss and turn. 

Hence!  The bed features two twin matresses (split king bed), and a fold-out desk that doubles as bed support.  The desk's virtue lies in that (1) there is enough space to leave keyboards, laptops etch set up while sleeping and (2) we both won't need to work at the same small kitchen table.  

More to come as I assemble and test it.
